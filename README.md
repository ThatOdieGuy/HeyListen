An Android sound board for Zelda's Navi that will play in the background

Select Navi's sounds manually. Or select a time interval above to play automatically at random times.

This is just something I quickly threw together for a friend who wanted a Navi puppet with a bluetooth speaker for her cosplay to randomly play songs.
